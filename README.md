# AI-Pacman-Project-2
This is my solution to the Berkeley AI Pacman Project 2.

https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/project2.html

In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. I was asked to implement the Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax and  Evaluation Function algorithms.

The only file I edited:

    multiAgents.py	
Where all of the multi-agent search agents reside.
